Scenario 1 addresses the case where all aquaculture is able to grow faster than under the baseline scenario by 50 percent between 2011 and 2030. In particular, the scenario assumes faster technological progress such that aquaculture would be able to supply a given amount at a lower cost (supply curves would shift outward), but it assumes the same feed requirements per unit weight of aquaculture production.
