For this analysis, we use four climate scenarios that span the range of the means of the GCM ensemble results and also have the requisite monthly average minimum and maximum temperature data needed for the crop modeling analysis. The CSIRo A1B and B1 scenarios represent a dry and relatively cool future; the MIRoC A1B and B1 scenarios represent a wet and warmer future.

SCENARIOS
- Scenario 1,SSP2_GFDL
- Scenario 2,SSP2_HGEM
- Scenario 3,SSP2_IPSL
- Scenario 4,SSP2_MIROC
- Scenario 5,SSP2_NoCC
