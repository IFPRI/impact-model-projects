This projects simulates the adoption of improved crop varieties across various regions of the world. Effects of this adoption are estimated on agriculture productivity, in 2050 under assumptions of a current climate or under climate change conditions. Through modeling of changes in crop yields, the analysis also explains how the different varieties may affect food prices and trade flows.

METHODOLOGY

A wealth of technologies and practices are available to increase the resilience of agro-ecosystems to both abiotic and biotic stresses. In order to prioritize research and investments in agriculture, more work needs to be done to explore the potential of various technologies to increase agricultural productivity, and alleviate poverty and hunger, for specific crops and under specific local soil and climatic conditions. This analysis needs to be performed at various levels of aggregation, from global to national to sub-national scales. This study analyzes the effects of improved varieties of maize, rice, wheat, potato, sorghum, and groundnut, as a mean to adapt to climate change. Specifically the focus is on varieties with characters of drought tolerance, heat tolerance or a combination of the two. Analysis also includes the effects of crop protection measures, with a focus on the mealybug pest on cassava.

The DSSAT suite of crop simulation models was used to represent improved crop varieties of maize, rice, wheat, sorghum, and groundnut, and estimate changes in yields following the adoption of these varieties in specific geographical areas of the world (see table below). For cassava, three different management options to control infestation from the mealybug pest were examined. The results were used as inputs to the IMPACT model system to determine the effects from adoption of the new varieties on yields, production and world prices. Simulations were run under a no-climate-change baseline scenario (unchanged 2005 climate ) and a climate change scenario originating from the GFDL-ESM2M climate model under a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 8.5. Climate scenarios are based on the middle-of-the-road SSP2 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. Both climate and socioeconomic scenarios used in IMPACT are based on work developed for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Overall we compare a no-climate-change scenario and a climate change scenario that is expected to cause significant changes to the agricultural system. The GFDL climate change scenario was chosen for this analysis because representative of one of the driest futures from the various climate models—the idea being to test the new crop varieties in a worst-case scenario.


AUTHORS AND COLLABORATORS

This study is part of the Global Futures and Strategic Foresight Project (GFSF), a collaborative effort led by IFPRI in partnership with eleven other CGIAR Centers: CIAT, CIMMYT, CIP, ICARDA, ICRAF, ICRISAT, IITA, ILRI, IRRI, IWMI and WorldFish. Team members represent a wide range of disciplines and expertise, including agricultural economics, crop modeling, animal sciences, hydrology, natural resource management, geographic information systems and computer science. The team also collaborates with leading climate, crop, and economic modelers from a variety of other institutions around the world through the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP).
