The International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) was developed at IFPRI at the beginning of the 1990s to address a lack of long-term vision and consensus among policy-makers and researchers about the actions that are necessary to feed the world in the future, reduce poverty, and protect the natural resource base. The model is typically used to perform scenario analysis in order to evaluate the effect of policy and technological choices on food supply and demand, trade and food security outcomes. A suite of baseline scenarios provides a reference point to estimate the consequences of changes in a number of inputs and drivers (e.g., changes in area or yield growth rates, etc). The baseline data presented here are the result of a major update in the release of the IMPACT model. The new baseline suite of scenarios is built around the SSP2 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway under 5 different possible climate change futures. SSP2 represents a middle of the road projection for population and GDP. The five climates that are used with SSP2 are NoCC, GFDL, MIROC, IPSL, and HGEM (Hadley). NoCC represents the effects of historical climate going into the future. The others represent various Global Circulation Models (GCMs).

METHODOLOGY

As presented in more details in the methodology section of this webtool, the IMPACT model is a partial equilibrium, multi–commodity, multi-country model which generates projections of global food supply, demand, trade, and prices. In IMPACT, each country is linked to the rest of the world through international trade and demand is a function of prices, income, and population growth. Crop production is determined by crop and input prices, the rate of productivity growth, and water availability. 
In the latest version of the IMPACT model, both the code and input data went through a major revision process. The main changes include:
1.	Prices
2.	Land Allocation Market
3.	Activity-Commodity Framework
4.	New Geography
5.	New and Disaggregated Crops
6.	Water Models
7.	New Baseline Year
